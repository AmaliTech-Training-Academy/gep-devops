## Workflow Files

### 1. master-pipeline.yml (The Main Controller)

**What it does:** This is your control center. It runs other workflows based on what you select.

**When to use:** When you want to deploy the entire application or specific parts.

**How it works:**
- You manually trigger it from GitHub Actions UI
- You choose which pipelines to run (backend, frontend, security, etc.)
- It runs the selected workflows in the correct order
- It sends notifications to Slack about the deployment status

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Manual control over what gets deployed
- ✅ Runs infrastructure first (if selected)
- ✅ Uses rolling deployment for dev/staging
- ✅ Uses blue-green deployment for production
- ✅ Generates a deployment report

**How to trigger:**
1. Go to GitHub → Actions → Master Pipeline Orchestrator
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select environment (dev/staging/prod)
4. Check/uncheck what you want to run
5. Click "Run workflow"

---

### 2. backend-ci-cd.yml (Backend Deployment)

**What it does:** Builds and deploys backend microservices to AWS ECS.

**Services it deploys:**
- user-service
- event-service
- notification-service
- gateway-service

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Build and Test** - Compiles Java code and runs tests
2. **Security Scan** - Scans code for vulnerabilities using Trivy
3. **Build Docker Images** - Creates Docker containers
4. **Push to ECR** - Uploads images to AWS Elastic Container Registry
5. **Deploy to ECS** - Updates running services in AWS

**When it runs:**
- When triggered by master-pipeline.yml
- When triggered manually
- When triggered by repository_dispatch event

**Important notes:**
- Uses Maven for Java builds
- Each service is built and deployed independently (matrix strategy)
- Runs on self-hosted runners with "backend" label
- Waits for service stability before completing

---

### 3. frontend-ci-cd.yml (Frontend Deployment)

**What it does:** Builds and deploys the frontend application to AWS S3 + CloudFront.

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Gets the frontend repository code
2. **Setup Node.js** - Installs Node.js version 18
3. **Install Dependencies** - Runs `npm ci` or `npm install`
4. **Build** - Creates production build in `dist/` folder
5. **Upload to S3** - Syncs build files to S3 bucket
6. **Invalidate CloudFront** - Clears CDN cache so users get new version

**When it runs:**
- When triggered by master-pipeline.yml
- When triggered manually
- When triggered by repository_dispatch event

**Important notes:**
- Runs on self-hosted runners with "frontend" label
- Different S3 buckets for dev/staging/prod
- CloudFront invalidation ensures users see latest version immediately

---

### 4. backend-blue-green.yml (Production Backend Deployment)

**What it does:** Safely deploys backend to production using blue-green strategy.

**What is Blue-Green Deployment?**
- **Blue** = New version being deployed
- **Green** = Current version running
- Deploy to blue → Test blue → Switch traffic to blue → Keep green as backup

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Determine Current Environment** - Checks which version is running (green)
2. **Deploy to Blue** - Deploys new version to blue environment
3. **Health Check** - Tests blue environment (10 attempts, 30s apart)
4. **Smoke Tests** - Tests critical API endpoints
5. **Switch Traffic** - Points load balancer to blue environment
6. **Monitor** - Watches for 5 minutes for issues
7. **Cleanup** - Scales down green environment
8. **Rollback** - If anything fails, switches back to green

**When it runs:**
- Only for production environment
- Only when called by master-pipeline.yml

**Safety features:**
- ✅ Automatic health checks
- ✅ Automatic rollback on failure
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployment
- ✅ Green environment kept as backup

---

### 5. frontend-blue-green.yml (Production Frontend Deployment)

**What it does:** Safely deploys frontend to production using blue-green strategy.

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Deploy to Blue S3 Bucket** - Uploads new version
2. **Test Blue Environment** - Checks if site loads (5 attempts)
3. **Lighthouse Performance Test** - Measures performance score (must be ≥80)
4. **Switch CloudFront** - Updates CDN to serve from blue bucket
5. **Invalidate Cache** - Clears CDN cache
6. **Monitor** - Watches for 3 minutes
7. **Rollback** - If anything fails, switches back to green bucket

**When it runs:**
- Only for production environment
- Only when called by master-pipeline.yml

**Performance requirements:**
- Lighthouse score must be 80 or higher
- Site must be accessible within 5 attempts

---

### 6. infrastructure-ci-cd.yml (Terraform Infrastructure)

**What it does:** Manages AWS infrastructure using Terraform.

**What it manages:**
- VPC, subnets, security groups
- ECS clusters and services
- Load balancers
- S3 buckets
- CloudFront distributions
- RDS databases
- IAM roles and policies

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Validate** - Checks Terraform syntax
2. **Format Check** - Ensures code is properly formatted
3. **Security Scan** - Runs Checkov and TFSec
4. **Plan** - Shows what will change (for PRs)
5. **Apply** - Creates/updates infrastructure (for main branch)

**When it runs:**
- **Automatically:** When you push to main/dev/staging branches and change terraform/ files
- **Manually:** Via workflow_dispatch
- **Pull Requests:** Runs plan and comments on PR

**Important notes:**
- State stored in S3 bucket (defined in secrets)
- State locking using DynamoDB
- Separate state files for dev/staging/prod
- Automatic backups of state files
- Runs on self-hosted runners

**Actions you can perform:**
- `plan` - Preview changes
- `apply` - Apply changes
- `destroy` - Delete resources (use carefully!)

---

### 7. health-monitoring.yml (Service Health Checks)

**What it does:** Regularly checks if all services are running properly.

**What it checks:**
- **Frontend:** HTTP status of web applications
- **Backend:** Health endpoints of all microservices
- **Database:** Connection to PostgreSQL
- **ECS Services:** Status of containers in AWS

**When it runs:**
- Manually triggered (scheduled runs are disabled)
- Can be called by other workflows

**How it works:**
```bash
# Frontend check
curl https://gep.com/health
# Expected: HTTP 200

# Backend check
curl https://api.gep.com/user-service/actuator/health
# Expected: HTTP 200

# Database check
timeout 10 bash -c "</dev/tcp/DB_HOST/5432"
# Expected: Connection successful
```

**Note:** Scheduled runs are commented out. Uncomment the cron line to enable automatic checks every 15 minutes.

---

### 8. performance-monitoring.yml (Performance Testing)

**Tests performed:**
1. **Load Testing** - Uses K6 to simulate multiple users
2. **Lighthouse Audit** - Measures frontend performance
3. **Database Performance** - Checks RDS CPU and metrics

**Load test parameters:**
- **Staging:** 10 virtual users for 2 minutes
- **Production:** 25 virtual users for 3 minutes

**When it runs:**
- Manually triggered (scheduled runs are disabled)
- Can be called by other workflows

**Performance thresholds:**
- Lighthouse score should be ≥80
- Response times should be acceptable
- No errors during load test

---

### 9. security-monitoring.yml (Security Scanning)

4. **SSL Certificate Check** - Verifies certificates aren't expiring soon

**When it runs:**
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)
- Manually triggered
- Can be called by other workflows

**What happens if issues are found:**
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Warnings shown in workflow logs
- Slack notification sent (if enabled)

**SSL certificate warnings:**
- Alert if certificate expires in less than 30 days

---

### 10. terraform-deploy-oidc.yml (Alternative Terraform Deployment)

**What it does:** Deploys infrastructure using OIDC authentication (more secure than access keys).

**Difference from infrastructure-ci-cd.yml:**
- Uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) instead of AWS access keys
- Simpler workflow
- Runs on GitHub-hosted runners
- Good for organizations with strict security requirements

**When it runs:**
- When you push to main branch and change terraform/ files
- On pull requests to main branch

**Note:** This is an alternative to infrastructure-ci-cd.yml. Use one or the other, not both.

## How GitHub Actions Work

### Basic Concepts

**1. Workflow**
- A YAML file that defines an automated process
- Located in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Contains one or more jobs

**2. Job**
- A set of steps that run on the same runner
- Jobs run in parallel by default
- Can depend on other jobs using `needs:`

**3. Step**
- Individual task within a job
- Can run commands or use actions
- Steps run sequentially

**4. Runner**
- A server that runs your workflows
- Can be GitHub-hosted or self-hosted
- Our workflows use self-hosted runners

**5. Action**
- Reusable unit of code
- Can be from GitHub Marketplace or custom
- Example: `actions/checkout@v4`

### Workflow Syntax Example

```yaml
name: My Workflow                    # Workflow name

on:                                  # When to run
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:                 # Manual trigger

env:                                 # Environment variables
  NODE_VERSION: '18'

jobs:                                # Jobs to run
  build:                             # Job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest           # Runner type
    steps:                           # Steps in job
      - name: Checkout code          # Step name
        uses: actions/checkout@v4    # Use an action
      
      - name: Run command            # Another step
        run: echo "Hello World"      # Run a command
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Deployment (Dev & Staging)

**How it works:**
1. Deploy new version
2. Old version is replaced
3. Simple and fast

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple
- ✅ Fast
- ✅ No extra resources needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Brief downtime possible
- ❌ Harder to rollback
- ❌ All users get new version immediately

**Used for:** Dev and Staging environments

### Blue-Green Deployment (Production)

**How it works:**
1. Deploy new version (blue) alongside old version (green)
2. Test blue version
3. Switch traffic from green to blue
4. Keep green as backup
5. If issues occur, switch back to green

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero downtime
- ✅ Easy rollback
- ✅ Test before switching
- ✅ Instant rollback if needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires double resources temporarily
- ❌ More complex
- ❌ Takes longer

**Used for:** Production environment

2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Click on the failed job
4. Read the error message

**Step 2: Common issues and solutions**

#### "Authentication failed"
- **Cause:** AWS credentials expired or incorrect
- **Solution:** Check secrets in GitHub settings
- **How to fix:**
  1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
  2. Update AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  3. Re-run workflow

#### "Docker build failed"
- **Cause:** Code doesn't compile or Dockerfile has errors
- **Solution:** Test Docker build locally
- **How to fix:**
  ```bash
  cd backend/user-service
  docker build -t test .
  ```

#### "ECS service failed to stabilize"
- **Cause:** Container crashes or health checks fail
- **Solution:** Check ECS logs in AWS console
- **How to fix:**
  1. Go to AWS ECS console
  2. Find the service
  3. Check "Logs" tab
  4. Look for error messages

#### "Terraform plan failed"
- **Cause:** Invalid Terraform syntax or state lock
- **Solution:** Check Terraform files or unlock state
- **How to fix:**
  ```bash
  cd terraform/environments/dev
  terraform validate
  terraform fmt
  ```

#### "S3 sync failed"
- **Cause:** Bucket doesn't exist or no permissions
- **Solution:** Check bucket name and permissions
- **How to fix:**
  1. Verify bucket exists in AWS S3 console
  2. Check IAM permissions
  3. Verify secret S3_BUCKET_* is correct

### Rollback Production Deployment

**If blue-green deployment fails:**
- Automatic rollback happens automatically
- Traffic switches back to green environment
- Check Slack for notification

**If you need to manually rollback:**
1. Go to AWS ECS console
2. Find the service (e.g., gep-user-service-prod)
3. Update service to previous task definition
4. Or scale up green service and switch load balancer

### Checking Deployment Status

**In GitHub:**
- Go to Actions tab
- Look for green checkmark (success) or red X (failure)

**In AWS:**
- **ECS:** Check service status and task health
- **S3:** Verify files uploaded
- **CloudFront:** Check distribution status

**In Slack:**
- Check deployment notifications channel

### Self-Hosted Runner Issues

**Runner offline:**
1. SSH to runner machine
2. Check runner service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status actions.runner.*
   ```
3. Restart if needed:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.*
   ```

**Runner out of disk space:**
1. SSH to runner machine
2. Check disk usage:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
3. Clean up:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
   ```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Microservice

1. **Update backend-ci-cd.yml:**
   ```yaml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       service: [user-service, event-service, notification-service, gateway-service, NEW-SERVICE]
   ```

2. **Create ECS task definition:**
   - Add file: `ecs/task-definitions/NEW-SERVICE.json`

3. **Update Terraform:**
   - Add ECS service in `terraform/modules/ecs/`

4. **Test deployment:**
   - Deploy to dev first
   - Verify service runs
   - Deploy to staging
   - Deploy to production

### Changing Node.js Version

1. **Update frontend-ci-cd.yml:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Setup Node.js
     uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: '20'  # Change this
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to dev and test**

### Adding a New Environment Variable

1. **For backend (ECS):**
   - Update task definition JSON file
   - Add environment variable
   - Deploy service

2. **For frontend (build time):**
   - Add to build command in frontend-ci-cd.yml
   - Or add to .env file in frontend repo

3. **For workflows:**
   - Add to GitHub Secrets
   - Reference in workflow: `${{ secrets.NEW_SECRET }}`

### Updating Terraform Version

1. **Update infrastructure-ci-cd.yml:**
   ```yaml
   env:
     TF_VERSION: '1.7.0'  # Change this
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   terraform version
   cd terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init -upgrade
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Deploy to dev first**

### Enabling Scheduled Monitoring

**Health monitoring every 15 minutes:**
```yaml
# In health-monitoring.yml, uncomment:
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *'
```

**Performance monitoring every 6 hours:**
```yaml
# In performance-monitoring.yml, uncomment:
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
```

**Note:** Be careful with scheduled runs - they consume runner resources!

### Viewing Workflow Artifacts
